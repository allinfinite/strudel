# Musical Wireframe Sequencer - Implementation Complete ✅

All items from the plan have been successfully implemented and refined.

## ✅ 1. Quantized Timing System

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED & IMPROVED

- Master clock runs at 120 BPM with 16th note subdivisions
- `startMasterClock()` - runs at steady intervals
- `quantizeToGrid()` - schedules notes to nearest beat boundary
- `processQuantizedNotes()` - triggers queued notes at the right time
- **Improvement:** Fixed timing calculations to use proper seconds-based tolerance

**Files Modified:** `website/src/pages/webcam-music.astro` lines 657-705

## ✅ 2. Polyphony Limiting

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED & ENHANCED

- Maximum 6 simultaneous notes (increased from 4 for richer sound)
- Priority queue system based on gain values
- `stopLowestPriorityNote()` - intelligently removes notes
- **Improvement:** Mode-aware priority (bass notes get priority in sparse/melodic modes, percussion in rhythmic mode)

**Files Modified:** `website/src/pages/webcam-music.astro` lines 391-393, 763-798

## ✅ 3. Steady Beat Layer

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

- `playMetronome()` - kick on downbeat, hi-hat on other beats
- `playKick()` - synthesized kick drum with pitch envelope
- `playHiHat()` - noise-based hi-hat with decay
- **Improvement:** Beat intensity now adjusts continuously with motion (0.2 still → 0.8 moving)
- Visual feedback: wireframe lines pulse on beats (1.8x on downbeat, 1.3x on other beats)

**Files Modified:** `website/src/pages/webcam-music.astro` lines 800-853, 1253-1255

## ✅ 4. Mode-Based Musical Structures

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

All four modes working with quantized timing:

### Sparse Mode
- Low motion detected
- 1-2 notes per measure
- Long sustains (4-6 seconds)
- Only bass and ambient layers
- Beat intensity: 0.2 (subtle)

### Melodic Mode
- Medium motion (0.2-0.6)
- Arpeggiated patterns
- 4-8 notes active
- Melody + bass layers
- Beat intensity: 0.4

### Rhythmic Mode
- High motion (>0.6)
- Shorter notes (200-500ms)
- Percussive hits
- More active triggering
- Beat intensity: 0.8 (prominent)

### Structured Mode
- High saturation + medium motion
- Full harmonic layers
- Chord progressions
- Bass + melody + harmony
- Beat intensity: 0.6

**Files Modified:** `website/src/pages/webcam-music.astro` lines 959-1046, 1149-1207

## ✅ 5. Harmonic Intelligence

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED & IMPROVED

- Scale-locked frequencies using major pentatonic (C D E G A)
- Proper musical ratios: [1, 9/8, 5/4, 3/2, 5/3]
- `snapToScale()` - forces all notes to scale degrees
- Position-based octave selection (limited to 3 octaves for clarity)
- Depth affects harmonics (limited to prevent harsh sounds)

**Files Modified:** `website/src/pages/webcam-music.astro` lines 400-403, 918-957

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Timing Precision**
   - Fixed `quantizeToGrid()` to properly calculate seconds
   - Corrected `processQuantizedNotes()` tolerance (50ms = 0.05s)

2. **Musical Quality**
   - Proper pentatonic scale intervals instead of arbitrary ratios
   - Mode-aware polyphony limiting
   - Continuous beat intensity adjustment

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Enhanced beat pulse (1.8x downbeat, 1.3x other beats)
   - Active points highlighted in wireframe

4. **Performance**
   - Polyphony limit increased to 6 for richer sound
   - Smart note prioritization based on musical context

## Expected Results

✅ Steady, predictable beat users can follow
✅ Notes triggered in time with the beat (no random timing)
✅ Maximum 6 simultaneous notes (prevents chaos)
✅ Musical phrases change with motion but stay structured
✅ Smooth transitions between modes
✅ Proper musical harmony (pentatonic scale)
✅ Beat intensity adapts to motion dynamically

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Still Position:** Should hear sparse ambient pads, subtle beat
2. **Small Motion:** Melodic mode with arpeggios, medium beat
3. **Fast Motion:** Rhythmic mode with percussion, prominent beat
4. **Colorful Scene:** Structured mode with full harmony

All notes should align to the beat, creating a cohesive musical experience!
